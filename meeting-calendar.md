## Meeting Availability Test

#### Problem
The development team are required to have a mid month meeting in order to discuss the ongoing improvements and new features to the code base. This meeting is planned for the 14th of every month. Testing is also done on a monthly basis and should be done on the last day of the month.If the 14th falls on a Saturday or Sunday then the mid month meeting should be arranged for the following Monday.If the testing day falls on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday then testing should be set for the previous Thursday.#### Proposed SolutionWith this in mind, design an GET request that will return a JSON response outputting the fields/data for 'Month', 'Mid Month Meeting Date' and 'End of Month Testing Date' for the next six months.Please ensure all relevant documentation is supplied.
